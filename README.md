# clothing-product-recommender

Notebook for product recommendation based on image features, simulating the product recommendations usually seen in online stores with <i>You may also like...</i> or <i>Similar products</i> functionalities. Even though in real online website also use manually introduced information (type of product, brand, size, color...), in this notebook the only input is one picture of the item.

In the code, you will find the following structure:
* Dataset preparation
* Color based description of the image
* Gradient based description of the image
* Image ranking by similarity with the currently seen item, used as a query for retrieval
* Display of the 5 more similar products
